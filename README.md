## Code Description
This code implements a knightrider pattern with six LEDs and a 4-bit DIP switch that controls the speed of the pattern. The pattern consists of a sequence of LEDs that light up in a moving pattern, similar to the effect seen in the television show Knight Rider. The speed of the pattern can be controlled using the DIP switch, with 0000 representing the slowest speed at about 1 second per LED, 1111 representing the fastest speed at about 1/6 second per LED, and any number in between representing a range between the two extremes.
